    "## Batch Perceptron Algorithm\n",
    "### Description: \n",
    "- A perceptron is a linear classifier used for binary classification which divides the space into 2 partitions\n",
    "- Generally: the process is about getting the gradient at all points --> add them together --> update weighting coefficients\n",
    "- The batch training is a slow process because the update of the weighting coeff. vector happens after you iterate over all samples\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. The algorithm has the input of training samples X (features), Y (binary results 1,-1) and the learning rate (default = 1)\n",
    " 1. Weighting coefficient vector and delta vector is initialized with zeros and they have the same length as the # of features\n",
    " 1. Then for each point we calculate Weight.X (the prediction) and we check if the label matches the sign of prediction or not\n",
    " 1. If the sign mismatches, this indicates that the prediction was incorrect so we update the delta value until this delta value becomes so small which means it's not changing anymore\n",
    " 1. After all iterations are done we update the weights by subtracting the normalized delta obtained multiplied by learning rate\n",
    " 1. Finally we have the weight coefficients, the number of times required to update weights, the epochs & the delta values that will be plotted later\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Online Training Algorithm\n",
    "### Description: \n",
    "- The online training algorithm has the same process and functions of the batch perceptron algorithm but it's faster \n",
    "- We update the weighting coefficient vector after each sample"
